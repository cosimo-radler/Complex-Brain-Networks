# Complexity in Brain Networks - A Mathematical Investigation of Consciousness

**Authors:** Cosimo Radler, Jorge Gonzalez Larragoiti, Hsiag-Yang Lee 
**Date:** 27.06.2025

This Tutorial was designed for the course Complexity Lab, and is the final project. 

A comprehensive tutorial for analyzing **information processing patterns** in brain networks using **Higher-Order Interactions (HOI)** and **Partial Information Decomposition (PID)**.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to apply **complexity science** concepts to understand brain networks through information theory. It reveals how **emergence**, **synergy**, and **redundancy** shape information processing in the brain.

## What's Included

- **`Integrated_HOI_PID_Brain_Analysis_Tutorial_Complete.ipynb`** - Complete tutorial notebook
- **`AAL_timeseries_example.txt`** - Real fMRI brain data (92 regions, AAL atlas)

## Key Features

✅ **Complete Mathematical Framework** - HOI and PID measures implementation  
✅ **Real Brain Data Analysis** - 92-region fMRI connectivity analysis  
✅ **Comprehensive Visualization** - 12-panel analysis plot  
✅ **Complexity Science Focus** - Emergence, synergy, and redundancy patterns  
✅ **Educational Tutorial** - Step-by-step explanations and interpretations  

## Quick Start
